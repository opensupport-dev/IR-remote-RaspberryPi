<center><h1>FTDIX driver.</h1></center>
<p>

</p>
<p>The FTDIX driver is a MODE2 driver which is only capable of transmission.  It
uses the bitbang mode of an FTDI USB-to-serial chip such as the FT230X. It has
been tested with transmitters based on the the FT230X series of FTDI chips but
in theory it should work with most FTDI USB chips.  Note: Due to bugs in the
clock of the FT232R this driver will not work with IR blasters based on that
chip and you should used the ftdi driver instead.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>You can build your own FT230X based IR transmitters by purchasing an
<a href="http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Modules/DS_UMFT201_220_230XB.pdf">
FTDI UMFT201XB</a> and attaching an IR diode or you can purchase a ready-built
one from <a href="http://irblaster.info/usb_blaster.html">irblaster.info</a>.
Be sure to ask specifically for the FT230X based devices to avoid getting one
based on the FT232R.</p>
<p>

<h2>Which FTDI driver should I choose?</h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>lirc also includes another driver for FTDI devices called

By default, it searches for an usb device with <i>vendor:product</i> matching
0x0403:0x6015. This can be changed using the device argument which is a
comma-separated string of <i>key=value</i> assignments. The available keys
are:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>vendor: Numeric USB idVendor value of device to use [0403]</li>
    <li>product: Numeric USB idVendor value of device to use [6015]</li>
    <li>desc: USB descriptor of device to use [*]</li>
    <li>serial: USB idSerial value of device to use [*]</li>
    <li>output: output pin [2]</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The driver has support for listing available devices using e. g.,
using <i>mode2 -l </i></p>
