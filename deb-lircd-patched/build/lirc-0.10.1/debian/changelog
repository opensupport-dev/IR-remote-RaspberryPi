lirc (0.10.1-5.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload

  * debian/rules
    + Remove rdfind-based dedup (Closes: #919843)
      Using dh_installdocs --link-docs was investigated, and rejected due to
      - limited benefits;
      - interactions between lirc-docs shipping files under /usr/share/doc/lirc,
        but liblirc0 being the obvious candidate due to dependencies.

    + Do not install conffiles in a dummy location
      dpkg will, by default, not overwrite users' conffiles,
      so shipping them in a different location is superfluous.

  * Removed liblircclient{0,-dev}
    They were obsolete transitional packages that predated the stretch release.

  * Rename debian/post{inst,rm} to lirc.post{inst,rm}
  * debian/lirc.{postinst,prerm}: Recompile and remove Python bytecode as needed
    Closes: #924158

  * debian/control: Fix relationships on liblirc{,client}-dev.
    This should be Breaks+Replaces, not Conflict+Replaces.
    Using the former should ensure that upgrading from stretch works smoothly.

  * debian/changelog: Fix spelling in v0.10.1-4

        breakage on kFreeBSD; extend this change to all non-linux
        architectures, given that it fails on hurd as well. Use stdint.h and
        ISO C99 uint32_t/ uint64_t.
      + drop 11_cheklib_fix.patch; while it is technically correct, it doesn't
        actually have a real effect and is not upstreamable.
      + drop 90_make-module-defines-unique.patch and warning-cleanup.patch,
        lirc-modules-source doesn't get built anymore.
      + avoid patching generated Makefiles by ensuring identical dates to avoid
        autofoo/ libtool; this allows dropping 02_Makefiles.patch.

    - remove build time debug messages for kernel drivers
  * add compatibility for kernel 2.6.32 (Closes: #562512, #588027).
  * add compatibility for kernel 2.6.33/ 2.6.34.
  * add maintainerclean target to debian/rules, to ease dealing with the
    current way of maintaining the lirc package with svn-buildpackage's
    mergeWithUpstream mode.
  * document the kernel/ userspace ABI breakage between lirc 0.8.6 and earlier
    versions in NEWS.

    buildds with activated build concurrency).
  * fix lintian complaint about "lirc: conflicts-with-version makedev
    (<< 2.3.1-88)", a recent enough makedev (or none at all, if using udev) is
    only required by postinst, not at unpack time.

  * make syntax check for hardware.conf more robust.
  * drop obsolete lirc-svga package, its functionality is also provided by
    lirc-x and has only been built for x86.
  * drop and conflict with (using breaks) lirc-modules-source, starting with
    kernel 2.6.36 lirc has been merged mainline and this package targets
    post-squeeze anyways - this indirectly fixes:
    - Failed to attach i2c client PV951 IR at 0x4b (-17) (Closes: #500429)

    - 22_fix-spelling-errors.patch --> lirc_fix-spelling-errors.patch
    - 13_hurd_define_iotbase_u32.patch --> hurd_define-iotbase_u32.patch
  * external ABI between kernel modules broke between 0.8.3 --> 0.8.4 and
    0.8.7 --> 0.9.0, break lirc-modules-source (<<0.9.0~).
  * drop obsolete debconf configuration:
    - lirc should use debconf more fully (Closes: #162933)
    - [INTL:nl] Updated Dutch po-debconf translation (Closes: #605610).
    - [INTL:da] Danish translation of the debconf templates (Closes: #607575)

    moved to git.
  * don't symlink /usr/share/doc/<package>/ anymore.
  * declare a build-conflicts with libsvga1-dev.
  * suggest "ir-keytable", it is required to configure scancodes for in-kernel
    modules using the new RC_CORE subsystem.
  * bump standards version to 3.9.1, now that the major roadblocks are finally
    fixed.
  * document that lirc uses syslog for all logging functionality since 0.6.5-1,
    (Closes: #580666).
  * use current maintainer script syntax.
  * drop pre-squeeze versioned depends.

lirc (0.8.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * update swedish translation, thanks to Martin Bagge <brother@bsnet.se>
    (Closes: #491772).
  * add italian debconf translation, thanks to Vincenzo Campanella
    <vinz65@gmail.com>.
  * silence LIRC_MODE_LIRCCODE log message, as it is not rate limited and
    tends to overflow syslog in case IR receivers get removed without
    stopping lirc or removing the configuration; this is a temporary
    band-aid for lenny and no long term solution (Closes: #500421).

 -- Stefan Lippers-Hollmann <s.l-h@gmx.de>  Tue, 30 Sep 2008 01:28:27 +0200

lirc (0.8.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * remove dead code (modutils has only been used for kernel 2.4 and the
    affected code blocks weren't reachable since 0.8.3-1 anyways, as the
    conffile wasn't shipped in the first place).
  * conflict with makedev << 2.3.1-88, lirc either needs a fixed version or
    none at all (Closes: #477063).
  * 0.8.3-1 hasn't transitioned to testing yet, so keep the urgency at medium
    as it fixes several serious bugs (oops in lirc_i2c on kernel 2.6.25, FTBS
    against 2.6.26, missing module versions rejected by kernel >= 2.6.26,
    custom mknod replaced by proper makedev calls, if installed).

lirc (0.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * new upstream release 0.8.3 (Closes: #481649).
  * rediff patches:
    - 02_Makefile.in
    - 04_man_pages
    - 05_non_linux
    - 06_libtool_kfreebsd
  * drop patches merged upstream:
    - 16_kcompat-2.6.23
    - 17_kcompat-2.6.24
    - 20_kcompat-2.6.25
    - 19_enable-macmini-as-userspace-driver
  * remove local scope definition for variables in lirc.init.d following
    SUSv3, its current use for MODULES_MISSING and ARGS doesn't justify
    making use of the exceptions specified in Debian policy 10.4
    (Closes: #471422).
  * fix copy and paste error in lirc-modules-source.README.Debian.
  * lirc_i2c: fix kernel oops on 2.6.25, patch taken from upstream CVS.
  * change debconf defaults for lirc-modules-source:
    - drop lirc_gpio, it is affected by API changes in bttv and FTBS since
      2.6.23.
    - enable atiusb.
    - enable bt829.
    - enable cmdir.
    - enable igorplugusb.
    - enable imon.
    - enable it87.
    - enable mceusb/ mceusb2.
    - keep lirc_parallel disabled, it is not SMP safe.
    - enable sasem.
    - enable streamzap.
    - enable sir, keep the defaults at generic sir controller (other) port
      0x2f8 and irq 3, which seems to be supported by a short poll among
      notebook owners.
    - enable serial, keep defaulting to generic (home-brewed) IR receivers,
      change to ttyS0 (port 0x3f8, irq 4) as most concurrently sold systems
      only ship one serial port.
  * replace custom mknod usage by using makdev's newly added lirc support and
    add a versioned dependency on a fixed makedev version instead. This
    dependency can be relaxed to udev | makedev, once makedev (>= 2.3.1-88)
    has been shipped in a stable release. Given that Breaks support isn't
    usable until lenny+1, this conservative approach is the safer variant for
    etch --> lenny upgrades (Closes: #393575, #477063).
  * drop debian/lirc.config.in, which was added as a bandaid for #329897
    alltogether, neither it nor setup-driver.sh are used anywhere on the end
    user's system; this allows dropping the pre-dependency on dialog and
    lirc.config.md5sum as well.
  * add a sanity check to debian/rules' clean target to ensure that
    liblirclient0's pkg-config file is up to date.
  * add compatibility code for udev >= 0.117, avoid flag day changes or a hard
    dependency on udev; inspired by Scott James Remnant <scott@ubuntu.com>
    (Closes: #456325).
  * restructure lirc-modules-source package to dump all module sources
    directly into the toplevel directory (omit upstream's Makefiles from
    module subdirectories) and replace custom toplevel Makefile with a simple
    in-kernel style buildsystem. This fixes symbol versioning for the kernel
    modules and, as a side effect, the clean target of the top-level Makefile
    and doesn't allow empty port/ IRQ settings.
    (Closes: #450521, #483089, #369076)
  * add compatibility patch for kernels >= 2.6.26, based on upstream CVS.
  * drop debian/lirc.modules, modutils is obsolete (kernel 2.4).
  * make lirc-modules-source compatible with linux-modules-extra-2.6:
    - use bzip2 to compress the source tarball.
    - change path names to correspond with the package name.
  * fix LIRC_IRQ redefinition.

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * remove devfs support, it got removed in mainline linux for 2.6.18 so
    neither etch nor lenny are affected.
  * add LSB header to lirc initscript as suggested by Petter Reinholdtsen
    <pere@hungry.com> (Closes: #460212).
  * add LSB Description and Short-Description to initscript LSB stanza,
    borrowed from Ubuntu's lirc packages by Mario Limonciello
    <superm1@ubuntu.com>.
  * apply patch from Václav Ovsík <vaclav.ovsik@i.cz> to fix Makefile
    mangling for lirc-source, evaluating utsrelease.h instead of the no longer
    existing version.h and recommend linux-image-$KVERS instead of the
    obsolete kernel-image-$KVERS (Closes: #447172).
  * drop no longer existing dpatch suffix from patch series and refresh
    existing patches.
  * add compatibility patch for kernels >= 2.6.24, based on upstream CVS
    (Closes: #399135, #434569, #457858, #463388, #464777).
  * fix lirc.conf template for pinsys remotes, shortly before lirc 0.8.2 the
    keymapping got broken.
  * remove versioned download location from debian/copyright, it's always
    outdated and the base path will point to the download location just as
    well.
  * apply useful indention from Ubuntu to debian/rules.
  * Recommend module-assistant | kernel-package for lirc-modules-source.
  * add watch file pointing to lirc.org, not sourceforge.
  * restore author information and short descriptions for debian/patches/*.
  * add Basque translation "eu", thanks to Christian Perrier
    <bubulle@debian.org> and Piarres Beobide <pi@beobide.net>
    (Closes: #470363).
  * fix debian/copyright to refer to "GPL v2 or later", not a single source
    file seems to be licensed under the GPL v1.
  * rewrite debian/modules-source/debian/rules from scratch and rely on common
    kernel module handling based in module-assistant, this allows bumping the
    standards version to 3.7.3 (Closes: #372815, #440514).
  * add Homepage, Vcs-Svn and Vcs-Browser tags.
  * modules-source/README.make is obsolete, as it only talks about kernel 2.2
    and 2.4 specifics, while kernel 2.6 is covered by the other READMEs.
  * drop bogus Recommends from lirc-modules-source, build-essentials are an
    implicit requirement by definition.
  * drop no longer valid statements from the module READMEs.
  * no longer try to install etc/modutils/*, lenny will not support kernel
    2.4.
  * bump compat level to 5, which is supported by etch (backports), but lets
    dh_install error out if wildcards expand to nothing.
  * drop 03_extra_files, shipping private copies of bttv headers for random
    kernels doesn't work.
  * run debconf-updatepo, confirm that no strings get lost.
  * remove informal_module_building(), while it may look convenient to the
    user, the results were unpackaged modules of questionable quality that
    cannot be removed on purge. module-assistant or make-kpkg are the
    preferred way of module building (Closes: #404505).
  * Update and partly rewrite the module source documentation to the new
    packaging and explicitly mention the full source requirement for gio
    (Closes: #429249).
  * add patch based on upstream CVS to include the macmini driver in the
    hw_list used for calculating the userspace daemon config options
    (Closes: #448637).
  * set doc-base section to "Help", which seems to be suited best for a
    collection of pointers about how to work with the LIRC package.
  * fix broken whatis headers in shipped manpages.

 -- Hector Garcia <hector@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Jan 2006 03:58:59 +0100

lirc (0.7.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #310133)
    - support for KeySym and KeyCode in key definition
    - updated udev support for 2.6.13 kernels
    - added support for new version of Windows Media Center Remotes
    - Use all 8 bytes of IR code
    - Rewritten Sasem driver
    - added support for Asus Digimatrix
    - added support for Remotec Multimedia PC Remote BW6130
    - Added support for iMON-PAD and iMON-RSC
    - Man page for lircd doesn't talk about the wrond -D flag
      (Closes: #301688)
  * Change build-depend to kernel-source.
  * Change configure option --with-drivers to none on debian/rules.
  * Separated build and configure stages.
  * Deleted useless patch 01_configure-duplicates.dpatch
  * Deleted obsolete patch 02_forgotten-files.dpatch
  * Rewrite of 03_irxevent.dpatch to new version and renamed to 01_...
  * Rename 04_aclocal.dpatch to 02_aclocal.dpatch
  * Changed mv to cp on modules-source/Makefile
  * Updated po/es.po
  * Runned debconf-updatepo. (Closes: #329200)
  * Updated cs.po, da.po, es.po, de.po (not all, only fuzzy), fr.po, ja.po and
    vi.po
  * Created 03_extra_files.dpatch so module compilation only depends on
    kernel-headers. (Only 2.6.12 currently since is the only one for 2.6.x in
    debian that is supported upstream. Custom kernels should still use
    kernel-source).
  * Deleted build-depend on kernel-source.
  * Added depend on ucf.

  * Make dpkg-reconfigure work even when no /etc/lirc/lirc-modules.conf found

    separated). (Closes: #312102).
  * libusb-dev is already listed in Build-Depends, so this bug should have
    been already fixed (Closes: #317158).
  * Find the kernel source by testing for $KSRC/include/linux/version.h.
    (Closes: #301590).

    - Avoid deprecated use of chown (ie. s/root.root/root:root/).
  * Special thanks to J. Carlos Garcia Sogo for the quick tutorial on dpatch.

lirc (0.6.4-10) unstable; urgency=high

  * The urgency is because:
        + 0.6.4-9: may be uninstalable.
        + reduces user frustration on module building by giving a verbose
          error message.
        + Complies with policy by not restoring deleted conffiles on the users
          back.
        + Secures device permisions.
        + There is no new feature.
  * /etc/lirc/lircmd.conf may not be there (closes: Bug#126279).
  * Don't create /etc/lirc/* files unless they are there, they should be moved
    from /etc/ or the user chooses to reconfigure the package.
  * Add MODULE_LICENSE to kernel modules, patch by Ingo Saitz <ingo@debian.org>
    This was already fixed upstream, but oh well, lets not wait to the next
    release. (closes: Bug#128074)
  * Cry out if IRQ, PORT or TIMER are not set when compiling kernel modules.
    (closes: Bug#108131)
  * Tell devfsd to create /dev/lirc/0 unconditionaly. (works around: #128072)
    The proper fix should come soon from upstream.
  * Changed permisions of kernel devices from "root.video 660" to
    "root.root 660" since only lircd should use them and it runs as root.
        By writting to this devices you may confuse kernel code and that kind
        of thing should be reserved to root. If someone feels that read-only
        access should be allowed to to other users or groups go ahead and file
        a bug.

lirc (0.6.4-6) unstable; urgency=low

lirc (0.6.4-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * lirc was not building on powerpc because of the time difference with
    voltaire.debian.org. I was 'touch'ing configure.in to prevent rebuilding

    aggressive with the time change.
  * Use forkpty from libc, so I don't have to worry about devfs or devpts.
    closes: #115870 or at least makes it a libc problem :)
